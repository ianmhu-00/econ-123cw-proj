# This is a short econometrics writing project for ECON 123CW. The following paper analyzes the effect of higher education on poverty rates in the United States, including additional variables such as average K-12 spending per pupil, average post-secondary spending per pupil, urban percentage, gini coefficient, cost of living index, and unemployment rate.
# The paper will use regression tools such as best subsets modeling, t and F-statistics, and ANOVA testing.
# The analysis will require further study, chiefly a residual analysis that may include a histogram of transformed residuals (normality assumption), a QQ plot (normality assumption), Mahalanobis Distance (equal to or lesser number of outliers), absolute transformed residuals against transformed predicted values (constant variance assumption), and semi-variogram plot (adequate covariance). Additionally, polynomial or interaction terms may be necessary, however further study is required.
